NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Adjusted statistics are provided as a reference with extreme responses being excluded. They are calculated by discarding the top 1.5% AND bottom 1.5% responses. The number of discarded response(s) of each end is rounded UP to the nearest integer. The resultant data set will be used to calculate adjusted statistics in this report.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No section/course level adjusted statistics will be calculated if (i) one or more survey(s) receive(s) less than 3 responses; or (ii) this section/course is taught by multiple instructors, teaching support staff, and/or teaching assistants. It will be left blank in the cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. The response rate shown is the response rate for the instructor/course overall question, whichever is the higher. It is calculated as the number of responses received for the question divided by the maximum possible number of responses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Low response rate indicator indicates surveys whose response rates are too low for reliable comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. A section may be counted towards multiple programs/departments which are affiliated with the same or different school(s). Hence the total number of sections for all programs/departments may not necessarily tally with the number of sections for their home school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
