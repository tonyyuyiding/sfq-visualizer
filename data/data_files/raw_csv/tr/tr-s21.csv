"Note 1: The response rate shown is the response rate for the instructor/course overall question, whichever is the higher. It is calculated as the number of responses received for the question divided by the maximum possible number of responses.",,,,,,,,,,,
Note 2: A section may be counted towards multiple programs/departments which are affiliated with the same or different school(s). Hence the total number of sections for all programs/departments may not necessarily tally with the number of sections for their home school. The same situation may also occur in the totals for schools and university.,,,,,,,,,,,
