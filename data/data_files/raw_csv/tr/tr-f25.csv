"1. The response rate shown is the response rate for the instructor/course overall question, whichever is the higher. It is calculated as the number of responses received for the question divided by the maximum possible number of responses.",,,,,,,,,,,
2. A section may be counted towards multiple programmes / departments which are affiliated with the same or different school(s). Hence the total number of sections for all programmes / departments may not necessarily tally with the number of sections for their home school.,,,,,,,,,,,
