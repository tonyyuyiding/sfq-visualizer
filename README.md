# HKUST SFQ Visualizer

## Features

This project is a tool to visualize the Student Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ) survey results of HKUST.

Features include:

- Rankings for courses/instructors based on SFQ results
- History charts of SFQ results for each course/instructor

## Notes

The rankings and charts are completely based on the SFQ survey results published by the university. They have nothing to do with the attitude of the developers. The data is up to Summer 2024.

The data is for reference only. Small inaccuracy is possible in calculations. Besides, the SFQ results may be biased. As is mentioned on the university website, large classes tend to get lower ratings, and PG classes usually get higher ratings than UG ones.
